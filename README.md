### SubPay: A DeFi-Based Subscription Payment Protocol

## 📑 Project Description

SubPay is a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol that enables automated, recurring subscription payments using stablecoins on the Celo blockchain. It bridges the gap between traditional subscription models and blockchain technology, offering businesses an efficient way to manage subscriptions while giving users full control over their payments.

### Key Features (Implemented)

- **Smart Contract-Based Subscriptions** – Automates recurring payments with user-defined parameters.
- **Stablecoin Integration** – Uses cUSD for stable payments.
- **Fraud Detection System** – Real-time monitoring of suspicious activities and payment patterns.
- **Business Management Dashboard** – Tools for creating, monitoring, and managing subscriptions.
- **User Sovereignty** – Transparent billing, easy modifications, and full user control over payments.
- **Low Transaction Costs** – Reduces fees compared to traditional payment processors.
- **Progressive Web App** – Access features across desktop and mobile with offline support.

## 🔍 Problem Statement

The current Web3 ecosystem lacks efficient subscription payment solutions due to:

- **No Native Recurring Payment Mechanisms** – Blockchain transactions are typically one-time payments.
- **High Transaction Costs** – Traditional processors charge excessive fees.
- **Payment Reliability Issues** – No automated verification of wallet balances or user creditworthiness.
- **Limited Credit Assessment** – No traditional credit scoring in blockchain transactions.
- **Complex User Experience** – Many existing crypto subscription models require manual renewals.
- **Cross-Border Limitations** – High fees and regulatory barriers for global transactions.
