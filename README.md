It bridges the gap between traditional subscription models and blockchain technology, offering businesses an efficient way to manage subscriptions while giving users full control over their payments.

### 🌍 Key Features
- **Smart Contract-Based Subscriptions** – Automates recurring payments with user-defined parameters.
- **Stablecoin Integration** – Eliminates volatility concerns with Stable coin payments.
- **AI-Powered Risk Management** – Credit risk assessment, fraud detection, and payment optimization.
- **Business Management Dashboard** – Tools for creating, monitoring, and managing subscriptions.
- **User Sovereignty** – Transparent billing, easy modifications, and full user control over payments.
- **Low Transaction Costs** – Reduces fees (0.1-0.5%) compared to traditional payment processors (2-5%).

## 🚀 Problem Statement
The current Web3 ecosystem lacks efficient subscription payment solutions due to:
- ❌ **No Native Recurring Payment Mechanisms** – Blockchain transactions are typically one-time payments.
- 💸 **High Transaction Costs** – Traditional processors charge excessive fees.
- ⚠️ **Payment Reliability Issues** – No automated verification of wallet balances or user creditworthiness.
- 🔍 **Limited Credit Assessment** – No traditional credit scoring in blockchain transactions.
- 📉 **Complex User Experience** – Many existing crypto subscription models require manual renewals.
- 🌍 **Cross-Border Limitations** – High fees and regulatory barriers for global transactions.

**SubPay solves these issues by enabling smart contract-driven, stablecoin-based, and AI-optimized subscription payments.**
